# Tube status LEDs

This was written for the Hardware Hack day, part of Oxford's [Summer of Hacks](https://summerofhacks.io/).

This requires a Raspberry Pi and a strip of [Neopixels](https://learn.adafruit.com/neopixels-on-raspberry-pi). I used these [WS2811 LEDs](https://www.amazon.co.uk/WS2811-Digital-Individually-Addressable-Advertising/dp/B07QYW5X78/), which aren't Neopixels, but they worked fine with the Neopixel library.

I connected the LEDs' wires to the 5V, ground and BCM 18 (pin 12 on the Pi).
